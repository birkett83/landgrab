## What is ingress?
[Ingress](https://ingress.com/) is an augmented-reality game for Android and
iOS.

## What is IITC?
[Ingress Intel Total Conversion](https://iitc.app/) is a fan-made replacement
for the standard Ingress online map.

# What is Landgrab?
Landgrab is a mini-game built using IITC.

Ingress tracks which portals you have captured. Landgrab gives you a score for
each portal based on how many nearby portals you have captured. You get a more
points for capturing all of the portals in an area than you would for capturing
the same number of portals spread out more widely.

Landgrab does the same thing for portals you have visited; it will keep track
of scores for visits and scores for captures separately.

## How does it work?
Landgrab draws the [Voronoi
Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) of the portal network -
basically it divides the map up into regions around each portal.  Each portal
you have captured gets a score equal to the smallest number of regions you have
to cross to reach a portal that you *haven't* captured. Each regions is
coloured according to your score for that region.

Scores are shown in the portal detail view.
## How do I play it?
You need a userscript manager to use IITC. Go to the
[Releases](https://github.com/birkett83/landgrab/releases/) page and click on
landgrab.user.js to install the plugin.

## This is flakey as heck, what's the deal?
- I don't know javascript. I r clueless noob.
- It will only update the Voronoi diagram and teh scores when portal data has
  completely finished loading.
- The does not seem to be a way to get a full list of portals you've
  visited/captured, so you need to scroll around the map for it to load portal
  data and find them. Landgrab will store history in your browser once it has
  seen it, so you should only need to do this once for each area...
- If landgrab has seen a portal you have captured/visited but doesn't know
  where that portal's nearest neighbour is (typically at the edge of an area
  that was loaded, or in remote areas), you may see regions extending away to 
  infinity... try scrolling around to find a nearby portal...

# Credits
IITC was originally written by Stefan Breunig and IITC "Community Edition"
(IITC-CE) is now maintained by modos189 and others.

Landgrab was originally based on the Uniques plugin by 3ch01c.

Landgrab uses [d3-delunay](https://github.com/d3/d3-delaunay) to compute the
Voronoi diagram.
